This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [video.js](http://videojs.com) plugins. It is based on the recommendations of the video.js core team as well as tools and conventions for developing plugins at [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com).

## Getting Started

If you don't know what Yeoman is or what generators are, check out the Yeoman ["Getting Started"](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) document. Long story short, make sure you have Yoeman and this generator installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-videojs-plugin
```

Then, starting your video.js plugin is as simple as:

```bash
yo videojs-plugin
```
